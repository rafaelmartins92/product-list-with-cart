# Product List Project 🛒

This project is a product list with a functional shopping cart, built as part of a front-end development challenge.

## 📝 Brief

The goal of this project was to build a product list interface with an interactive shopping cart, closely following the design to ensure a visually pleasing and responsive user experience, adapted for different screen sizes.

## 🎯 Features

Users can:

- **Add** and **remove** items from the cart
- **Increase** or **decrease** the number of items in the cart
- See an **order confirmation modal** when clicking "Confirm Order"
- **Reset** their selections when clicking "Start New Order"
- Navigate the entire project and perform all actions **using only their keyboard**
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device’s screen size
- See **hover** and **focus states** for all interactive elements

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **React**: Component and application state management
- **CSS**: Styling and responsiveness
- **React Hooks**: State and side-effect management
- **Context API**: Global state management for the shopping cart
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation for all buttons

## 🛠️ Technical Challenges

One of the main challenges was ensuring the shopping cart was fully functional and accessible. I used **React Hooks** and **Context API** to simplify state management and improve code organization. Accessibility was a key focus, allowing users to navigate the interface solely with the keyboard.
